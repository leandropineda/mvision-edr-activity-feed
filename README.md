# MVISION EDR - ACTIVITY FEED [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/mcafee/mvision-edr-activity-feed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mcafee/mvision-edr-activity-feed)


## OVERVIEW
- Open Source ActivityFeed integrated with OpenDXL streaming client (https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-streaming-client-python).
- ``mvision-edr-activity-feed`` is a command line tool to consume and subscribe to events from MVISION EDR


## INSTALL
Run either:
.. code:: shell

    python setup.py install
   
   
## COMMAND LINE USAGE

In order to use the CLI, you need credentials in MVEDR.
The CLI has several parameters (as described with
``mvision-edr-activity-feed  -h``):

::

    usage: mvision-edr-activity-feed  [-h] [--version] --url URL --username
                                      USERNAME --password PASSWORD --module MODULE
                                      [--wait WAIT]
                                      [--loglevel {critical,error,warning,info,debug,notset}]
                                      [--logfile LOGFILE] [--reset]
                                      [--consumer-group CONSUMER_GROUP]
                                      [--config CONFIG]

    MVISION EDR Event Dispatcher CLI

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      --url URL             Base URL for MVISION EDR (default: None)
      --username USERNAME   Username for the service (default: None)
      --password PASSWORD   Password for the service (default: None)
      --module MODULE       Module to register events (default: None)
      --wait WAIT           Time to wait between queries (default: 5)
      --loglevel {critical,error,warning,info,debug,notset}
      --logfile LOGFILE
      --topic TOPIC         Topic to subscribe to (default: ['case-mgmt-events',
                            'BusinessEvents', 'threatEvents'])
      --reset               Starts the consumer group from the earliest event
                            available. This only works when initializing the
                            consumer group the first time (default: False)
      --consumer-group CONSUMER_GROUP
                            Name for the consumer group to use (default:
                            mcafee_investigator_events)
      --config CONFIG       Configuration key/value pairs for callbacks (default:
                            None)


## SUBSCRIPTIONS

You need to provide at least one module with your subscriptions for the
CLI to load. The following is an sample subscription:

.. code:: python

    import logging
    from mvision_edr_activity_feed import subscribe


    @subscribe(entity='case', subtype='creation')
    def case_created(event):
        logging.info("CASE CREATED: %s", event)


    @subscribe(entity='case', subtype='priority-update')
    def case_updated(event):
        logging.info("CASE PRIORITY UPDATED: %s", event)


    @subscribe(entity='case', subtype='status-update')
    def case_status_updated(event):
        logging.info("CASE STATUS UPDATED: %s", event)


    @subscribe("user == 'some_user'")
    def custom_subscription(event):
        logging.info("EVENT FOR USER 'some_user': %s", event)

In the first three examples, we are subscribing to the following events: **Case
creation**, **Case priority updates**, and **Case status updates**. On the
last example we are subscribing to events that have a property ``user`` with a
value of ``some_user`` (as defined by the corresponding `JMESPath <http://jmespath.org/>`_ expression)

Note that there are two ways to subscribe to events:

* **Basic**: This is for events that follow out `Event Specification <EVENT_SPEC.rst>`__

    * **entity**: The entity affected by the event.
    * **subtype**: The event subtype, related to the entity.

* **Advanced**: This is for generic events, and uses a `JMESPath <http://jmespath.org/>`_ expression to determine the subscription


## CONFIGURE RSYSLOG IN CASE OF REMOTE LOGGING

In case of using rsyslog for remote logging please follow the documentation explained here: https://www.tecmint.com/setup-rsyslog-client-to-send-logs-to-rsyslog-server-in-centos-7/

rsyslog.conf that can be used as an example: https://github.com/mcafee/mvision-edr-activity-feed/blob/feature/activity_feed_integration/rsyslog.conf

## RUNNING THE EXAMPLES

There are a couple of simple examples that will log event information to
the console. These are executed as follows:

.. code:: shell

    mvision-edr-activity-feed --url https://api-int-cop.soc.mcafee.com/ --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD --module samples.generic --loglevel=debug

.. code:: shell

    mvision-edr-activity-feed --url https://api-int-cop.soc.mcafee.com/ --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD --module samples.individual --loglevel=debug

You can also mix several modules in a single call:

.. code:: shell

    mvision-edr-activity-feed --url https://api-int-cop.soc.mcafee.com/ --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD --module samples.generic --module samples.individual --loglevel=debug

## PARSING RULE ON McAfee SIEM

For convenience a `Docker` image is provided. For running `MVISION EDR` activity feed client and forward threat events to `McAfee ESM` via `syslog`, follow instructions below.

### BUILDING DOCKER IMAGE

To forward events gather from the cloud, a `rsyslog` daemon will run inside the `Docker` container. To reduce the number of events sent to the `ESM` receiver, a filter is applied to discard all logs that doesn't contain `"Threat Detection Summary"` string. All other events will be forwarded to the `ESM` receiver (see [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile#22)). `ESM` reciever IP must be provided when building the `Docker` image and cannot be changed later. That means if you need to change the receiver IP, the `Docker` image must be rebuilt.

```bash
docker build --rm --build-arg esm_ip=<ESM_RECEIVER_IP> -t mvision-edr-activity-feed .
```

If you are behind a proxy, add the following parameter while building the image:

```bash
--build-arg HTTP_PROXY="<PROXY_URL_OR_IP:PROXY_PORT>" \
--build-arg HTTPS_PROXY="<PROXY_URL_OR_IP:PROXY_PORT>" \
--build-arg http_proxy="<PROXY_URL_OR_IP:PROXY_PORT>" \
--build-arg http_proxys="<PROXY_URL_OR_IP:PROXY_PORT>" 
```

### RUNNING DOCKER IMAGE

As mentioned before, the `Docker` container spins it's own `rsyslog` daemon. To access `MVISION EDR` resources on the cloud, `username` and `password` must be provided.

*Note*: using a service account is advised.

```
docker run mvision-edr-activity-feed \
    --url https://api.soc.mcafee.com \
    --username user \
    --password pass \
    --module esm11 \
    --loglevel debug

```

If you are behind a proxy, add the following parameter:

```
--env HTTPS_PROXY="<PROXY_URL_OR_IP:PROXY_PORT>"
```

## Setup ESM Datasource

An `ESM` data source holds the location and connection information of your network's sources of data. It acts as a connector to your source of data. To instruct `ESM` to parse `MVISION EDR` threat events an `Advanced Syslog Parser` rule is provided (see [sample rule](./RULE_MVISION_EDR_THREAT.xml)). More information can be found at [McAfee Knowledge Center](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=PD26993).

### How to setup ESM for parsing MVISION EDR Threat events

* Go to `Policy Editor`. On the menu bar go to `File`, `Import`, `Rules` and click on `Import Rules`. A pop-up windows will prompt.
* Upload `RULE_MVISION_EDR_THREAT.xml` policy.
* Go back to the `Policy Editor` window, select `Advanced Syslog Parser`, and filter the list to locate the rule uploaded on the previous step (i.e. using `Signature ID` or `Name`). Make sure the rule is enabled.
* Disable aggregation (go to Datasources). Make sure rollout policy.
* Rollout the rule if needed (top right corner).

###Â Add client data sources

* From the `McAfee ESM` dashboard, click the hamburger menu and select `Configuration`.
* On the system navigation tree, select the Receiver, then click the `Properties` icon (small cog wheel).
* Click `Data Sources`, the `Add`.
* `Data Source Vendor` should be `Generic`, and select `Advanced Syslog Parser` as `Data Source Model`.
* Choose a `Name` and provide the `IP` address from which the client will run.
* Make sure port is `514` (`TLS` can be enabled but the port should be changed on the `Dockerfile` as well).
* Click `OK` and `Write` the data source settings to the receiver.
